## User Stories
The project's backend section centers on its administrative aspect and covers one user story:
- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete users, posts, comments and likes. This allows the admin to exercise control over the application's content and swiftly remove any inappropriate material.
<hr>

## Database

The following models were created to represent the database model structure of the application:

## Testing
The following tests were carried out on the app:
1. Manual testing
2. Automated testing

### Manual Testing

- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete users, posts, comments and likes. This allows the admin to exercise control over the application's content and swiftly remove any inappropriate material.

**Test** | **Action** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result**
-------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -----------------
User | Create, update & delete user | A user can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
User | Change permissions | User permissions can be updated | Works as expected
Profile | Create, update & delete | User profile can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Post | Create, update & delete | A post can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Comment | Create, update & delete | A comment can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Like | Create & delete | A like can be created or deleted (like / unlike post) | Works as expected
Follower | Create & delete | Follow or unfollow user | Works as expected

In addition, posts, comments, likes and following can be created by logged-in users only. Users can only update or delete the content which was created by themselves.

### Automated Testing

Even though automated testing was not required for this project, I decided to go ahead with it and I can say that it was a huge help! It helped me to discover a few errors in my code before I started to manually test all the different functions.

Automated testing was done using the Django Rest Framework APITestCase.

A total of 34 tests were created and they all passed.

## Deployment

### Creating the project:
1. Create the GitHub repository.
2. Create the project app on Heroku.
3. Add the Postgres package to the Heroku app.
4. Once the GitHub repository was launched on GitPod, installed the following packages in terminal with install command:
```
'django<4'
django-cloudinary-storage
Pillow
djangorestframework
django-filter
dj-rest-auth==2.1.9
'dj-rest-auth[with_social]'
djangorestframework-simplejwt
dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
gunicorn django-cors-headers
whitenoise
```

5. Created the Django project with the following command:
```
django-admin startproject project_name .
```

6. Back in Heroku, and under the Settings tab, added the following configvars:
    * Key: SECRET_KEY | Value: hidden
    * Key: CLOUDINARY_URL | Value: cloudinary://hidden
    * Key: DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC | Value: 1
    * Key: ALLOWED_HOST | Value: drf-api-app-name.herokuapp.com

7. 0nce the ReactApp has been created added two additional configvars:
    * Key: CLIENT_ORIGIN | Value: https://react-app-name.herokuapp.com
    * Key: CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV | Value: https://gitpod-browser-link.ws-eu54.gitpod.io
        * Check that the trailing slash "/" at the end of both links has been removed.
        * Gitpod occasionally updates the browser preview link. Tthe CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV value then0 needs to be updated for development purposes.

8. Created the env.py file, and added the following variables. The value for DATABASE_URL was obtained from the Heroku configvars in the previous step:
```
import os`
os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = 'cloudinary://hidden'
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'postgres://hidden'
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'secret-key-of-mine'
os.environ['CLIENT_ORIGIN'] = 'https://8000-darkozlatar-djangorestf-hidden'
# os.environ['DEV'] = '1'
```

### Settings.py:

9.  Update INSTALLED_APPS by adding the following to support the newly installed packages:
```
'cloudinary_storage',
'django.contrib.staticfiles',
'cloudinary',
'rest_framework',
'django_filters',
'rest_framework.authtoken',
'dj_rest_auth',
'django.contrib.sites',
'allauth',
'allauth.account',
'allauth.socialaccount',
'dj_rest_auth.registration',
'corsheaders',
```

10. Import the database, the regular expression module & the env.py

```
from pathlib import Path
import os
import dj_database_url
import re
if os.path.exists('env.py'):
        import env
```

11. Below the import statements, add the following variable for Cloudinary and below INSTALLED_APPS, set site ID:

```
CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {'CLOUDINARY_URL': os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_URL')}
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```

```
SITE_ID = 1
```

12. Below BASE_DIR, create the REST_FRAMEWORK, and include page pagination to improve app loading times, pagination count, and date/time format and set the default renderer to JSON::

```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [(
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication'
        if 'DEV' in os.environ
        else 'dj_rest_auth.jwt_auth.JWTCookieAuthentication'
    )],
    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS':
        'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination',
    'PAGE_SIZE': 10,
    'DATETIME_FORMAT': '%d %b %Y',
}
if 'DEV' not in os.environ:
    REST_FRAMEWORK['DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES'] = [
        'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',
    ]
```

13. Then beneath that, added the following JWT code:
```
REST_USE_JWT = True
JWT_AUTH_SECURE = True
JWT_AUTH_COOKIE = 'my-app-auth'
JWT_AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE = 'my-refresh-token'
JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE = 'None'
```

14. Underneath JWT tokens, added:
```
REST_AUTH_SERIALIZERS = {
    'USER_DETAILS_SERIALIZER': 'project-name.serializers.CurrentUserSerializer'
}
```

15. Updated DEBUG variable:
```
DEBUG = 'DEV' in os.environ
```

16. Updated the DATABASES variable:
```
if 'DEV' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
        }
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
    }
```

17. Add heroku app to ALLOWED_HOSTS:
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
   os.environ.get('ALLOWED_HOST'),
   '*',
]
```

18. Added the CORS_ALLOWED variable as shown in DRF-API walkthrough:
```
if 'CLIENT_ORIGIN' in os.environ:
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
        os.environ.get('CLIENT_ORIGIN')
     ]
if 'CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV' in os.environ:
    extracted_url = re.match(r'^.+-', os.environ.get('CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV', ''), re.IGNORECASE).group(0)
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
        rf"{extracted_url}(eu|us)\d+\w\.gitpod\.io$",
    ]

CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True
```

19. Added corsheaders to the top of MIDDLEWARE:
```
    'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
```

### Final stage:

20. Created a Procfile, & added the following two lines:
```
release: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi
```

21. Migrated the database:
```
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate
```

22. Save the requirements to requirements.txt with:
```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

23. Added, committed & pushed the changes to GitHub

24. Navigated back to Heroku, to the â€˜Deployâ€™ tab, and connected the app to the GitHub repository.

25. Deployed the branch.
