## Testing
The following tests were carried out on the app:
1. Manual testing
2. Automated testing

### Manual Testing

- As an admin, I want to be able to create, edit and delete users, posts, comments and likes. This allows the admin to exercise control over the application's content and swiftly remove any inappropriate material.

**Test** | **Action** | **Expected Result** | **Actual Result**
-------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | -----------------
User | Create, update & delete user | A user can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
User | Change permissions | User permissions can be updated | Works as expected
Profile | Create, update & delete | User profile can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Post | Create, update & delete | A post can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Comment | Create, update & delete | A comment can be created, edited or deleted | Works as expected
Like | Create & delete | A like can be created or deleted (like / unlike post) | Works as expected
Follower | Create & delete | Follow or unfollow user | Works as expected

In addition, posts, comments, likes and following can be created by logged-in users only. Users can only update or delete the content which was created by themselves.

### Automated Testing

Even though automated testing was not required for this project, I decided to go ahead with it and I can say that it was a huge help! It helped me to discover a few errors in my code before I started to manually test all the different functions.

Automated testing was done using the Django Rest Framework APITestCase.

A total of 34 tests were created and they all passed.
